Ethiopian Computational Community 
============

Welcome to Ethiopian Computational Community github page. We are a group of students, staff, and researchers interested in open science, coding, reproducible research, and research with computational methods. We're an open group and anyone associated with Axum University is welcome to join, attend, or lead a session. 



## Wait What's a 'Ethiopian Computational Community'?

Ethiopian Computational Community are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.

We keep our lessons and talks in a separate repository - [studyGroupLessons](https://github.com/et-com/etcom) - to help keep things organized. Take a minute to check them out!
