Addis's Study Groups

Thank you for visiting. This group is designed to bring everyone in the Ethiopian Energy community interested in improving their code, enhancing their data analysis abilities, building new skills, and working in a collaborative environment together. We are a community-led group that's open to new ideas and here to work with you.

### Wait What's a 'Study Group'?

We are partnering with the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://www.mozillascience.org/)'s Study Group project. Mozilla Study Groups are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.

## For Participants

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi.
 - **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
 - **Add yourself to the website:** If you'd like to appear on the website under the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the `_data/members.yml`; send us a pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for you.
